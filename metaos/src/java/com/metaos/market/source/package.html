Different types of data sources.<br>
<br>
<p>
Interfaces govern the structure of the package:
  <ul>
    <li>Lines with prices are provided by <i>PricesSource</i>s.</li>
    <li>Each line is processed by <i>SourceLineProcessor</i>s.</li>
    <li>Who notifies to subscribed listeners (of types <i>PricesListener</i>
        and <i>MarketListener</i></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Different types of <i>PricesSource</i>s are given:
  <ul>
    <li><i>SecondOrderSource</i> for source files with two orders: first in 
            symbol, second in time.</li>
    <li><i>OrderedSource</i> for source files with order only in time.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
<i>SourceLineProcessor</i>s try to parse each line, verifies if it's
valid (in any sense), which symbols are present in the line, the date of
the line and notifies to listeners when a set of lines are completely
read and should be managed.
<br>
It's important to take into account the process as a whole:
<ol>
  <li><i>PriceSource</i> concrete class gets line by line from the source
        of data (for instance as <i>OrderedSource</i> does with CSV file 
        with only one symbol per line sorted by date).</li>
  <li>After reading a line, a <i>SourceLineProcessor</i> gets information
        like processed symbol, date and positional numeric values (for example,
        <i>CSVSourceLineProcessor</i> deals with comma separated values,
        and remembers, for each position, which data is present: open price,
        volume, VWAP...)</li>
  <li>When a set of lines are read, maybe when date changes, <i>PriceSource</i>
        decides to ask to <i>SourceLineProcessor</i> for notifying listeners.
        (For example, <i>OrderedSource</i> calls function <i>concludeLineSet</i>
        on its <i>SourceLineProcessor</i> after every line is read, since
        it's supposed there will be no more than one line with a given date.)
        </li>
</ol>
