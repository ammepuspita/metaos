Different types of data sources.<br>
<br>
<p>
The most general usage is from a CSV file. But other implementations could
get data from KDB+, SQL databases, remote services...
</p>
<p>
All source of prices inherits from <i>PricesSource</i> interface.
<br>
The general design for these classes are as singletons, but it's only
a decission to mantain the esthetic coherence of the framework.
<br>
<i>PricesSource</i>s send messages to a subscribed market (using an observer
pattern) with names for symbols like "xxx-HIGH", "xxx-LOW", "xxx-OPEN"
or "xxx-CLOSE":
<code><pre>
this.sendPriceToMarkets(moment, symbol + "-HIGH", high);
this.sendPriceToMarkets(moment, symbol + "-LOW", low);
this.sendPriceToMarkets(moment, symbol + "-OPEN", open);
this.sendPriceToMarkets(moment, symbol + "-CLOSE", close);
this.sendVolumeToMarkets(moment, symbol, volume);
this.notifyListeners(moment, {symbol});
</pre></code>
<br>
To simplify notification process, <i>BasicPricesSource</i> abstract class is
provided, with methods to notify markets prices, asks, bids and volumes.
