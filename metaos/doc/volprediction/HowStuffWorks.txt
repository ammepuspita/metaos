The environment

    Directory A:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    files with weekly data, minute by minute, for all desired stocks.


    Directory B:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Set of subdirectories (one for each day) with stock trade data files 
    (one file per each stock):

            year/month/day/stockSymbol.1min.csv


    Directory C:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    Set of subdirectories (one for each day) with volume profile forecastings:
    one file per each symbol prediction.

            year/month/day/stockSymbol.volprofile.csv



Usage

    Weekly data file should placed at directory A.

    Forecasting process is executed, receiving complete path to file at
    directory A and location of directory B

    Forecasting results are:
        - new files in directory B, with daily information for each stock
        - new files in directory C, with daily volume profile forecastings
    


Pay attention to these risks

    New data overwrite old data. Thus, file at directory A, containing 
    information about a day and stock will produce a file for this day 
    and stock overwriting previously existing one in directory B.

    New forecastings overwrite previous forecastings.
